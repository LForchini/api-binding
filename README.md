# API Binding
This is a library that can be used to define a REST API.
For a quick example of it in use see my [opensky](https://github.com/LForchini/opensky) binding.

This is extracted from the [Gitlab REST API](https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-gitlab/-/tree/master/src/api).
Read the article on it [here](https://plume.benboeckel.net/~/JustAnotherBlog/designing-rust-bindings-for-rest-ap-is).
